/*
Add a field-searching capability, so sorting may bee done on fields within
lines, each field sorted according to an independent set of options. (The index for this book
was sorted with  -df for the index category and  -n for the page numbers.)

对字符串进行处理，截取指定长度的字段进行，根据截取的字符串进行排序。
sort -[dfnr] -[pos1] -[pos2]
